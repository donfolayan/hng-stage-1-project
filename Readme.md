# How to Use:

- Save the script as a file (e.g., create_users.sh).
- Make the script executable: chmod +x create_users.sh.
- Run the script with root privileges (using sudo) and provide the user data file path as an argument:

```
    sudo ./create_users.sh user_data.txt
```

## Requirements:

- Linux system with Bash shell.
- user_data.txt file (see script for format).
- Root privileges (use sudo).
